RabbitProducer: boot app which produces messages and has listener for ACK from consumers. But only consumer1 ACKs and not Consumer2

RabbitConsumer1: boot app which has listener with returning String. So this will write replies to reply queue(ie ack to producer)
RabbitConsumer2: boot app which has listener handler method is returning void. so this will not ack to producer
