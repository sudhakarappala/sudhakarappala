Producer: produces messages and has listener for ACK from consumers. But only consumer1 ACKs and not Consumer2

Consumer1 listener handler method is returning String. So this will write replies to reply queue(ie ack to producer)
Consumer2 listener handler method is returning void. so this will not ack to producer
